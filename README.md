# Ajax Multipart FormData Passing with jQuery

This project demonstrates how to prepare and pass form data, including file uploads, using jQuery's `$.ajax()` method. The form data is sent to a PHP backend for processing.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the form.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the form submission using jQuery and Ajax.
- `backend.php`: The PHP script that processes the incoming form data and files.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP).
- Internet connection for loading external dependencies (Bootstrap, jQuery).

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ajax-multipart-formdata-passing-with-jquery.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ajax-multipart-formdata-passing-with-jquery
    ```

3. **Start your local web server** and place the project directory in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

4. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
    ```plaintext
    http://localhost/ajax-multipart-formdata-passing-with-jquery/index.html
    ```

5. **Fill out the form** and submit. You can inspect the response in your browser's developer console or network tab.

### File Descriptions

- **index.html**:
    - Contains a form with fields for Full Name, Shop Name, Phone Number, Email Address, Shop Address, Profile Image, and Verify PIN.
    - Uses Bootstrap for styling.

- **script.js**:
    - Handles form submission using jQuery.
    - Collects form data and files, packages them into a FormData object.
    - Sends the FormData object to the backend PHP script using an Ajax POST request.

- **backend.php**:
    - Receives and processes the form data and files.
    - Prints the received data to the response (for debugging purposes).

### Key Features

- **Form Handling**:
    - Prevents default form submission behavior.
    - Uses `FormData` to handle both text data and file uploads.
    - Uses `$.ajax()` for asynchronous data submission.

- **Bootstrap Integration**:
    - Provides a responsive and modern UI for the form.

### Dependencies

- **Bootstrap**: Included via CDN.
- **jQuery**: Included via CDN.

### Example Usage

1. **Fill out the form**:
    - Enter text data in the respective fields.
    - Upload a file using the file input.

2. **Submit the form**:
    - The form data and file will be sent to `backend.php` for processing.

3. **Check the response**:
    - Open your browser's developer tools (F12).
    - Go to the Network tab and inspect the `backend.php` response.
    - Alternatively, check the Console for the response logged by the success callback.
